# rubrene-nanoparticle-dynamics
Simulations of the picosecond photophysics of pure and DBP-doped rubrene nanoparticle films.

This repository contains the code necessary to reproduce the kinetic simulations of rubrene and rubrene/DBP picosecond transient absorption dynamics in our paper [In optimized rubrene-based nanoparticle blends for photon upconversion, singlet energy collection outcompetes triplet-pair separation, not singlet fission](https://doi.org/10.1039/D1TC02955J).

### Requirements
- python
- matplotlib
- numpy
- scipy

### Notes
To reproduce the simulations found in the paper, simply download the repository, unzip, and run the scripts included in the ```scripts``` folder.
