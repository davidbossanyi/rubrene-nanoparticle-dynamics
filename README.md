# rubrene-nanoparticle-dynamics
Simulations of the picosecond photophysics of pure and DBP-doped rubrene nanoparticle films.

This repository contains the code necessary to reproduce the kinetic simulations of rubrene and rubrene/DBP picosecond transient absorption dynamics in our (soon to be published, we hope) article. This README will be updated with a link to the paper once it is published online.

### Requirements
- python
- matplotlib
- numpy
- scipy

### Notes
To reproduce the simulations found in the paper, simply download the repository, unzip, and run the scripts included in the ```scripts``` folder.
